# Unit 20 - "Looks like we've made our First Contract!"


## Background

At the new startup I have been tasked to create its own Ethereum-compatible blockchain to help connect financial institutions, and the team wants to build smart contracts to automate some company finances to make everyone's lives easier, increase transparency, and to make accounting and auditing practically automatic!

2 Contracts were created that 

* Pay your Associate-level employees quickly and easily, Associate Profit Splitter

* Distribute profits to different tiers of employees, Tiered Profit Splitter




* **Level One** is an `AssociateProfitSplitter` contract. This will accept Ether into the contract and divide the Ether evenly among the associate level employees. This will allow the Human Resources department to pay employees quickly and efficiently.

* **Level Two** is a `TieredProfitSplitter` that will distribute different percentages of incoming Ether to employees at different tiers/levels. For example, the CEO gets paid 60%, CTO 25%, and Bob gets 15%.


### Starting your project

Using [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org) and new contract called `AssociateProfitSplitter.sol` was created.

While developing and testing your contract, use the [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) development chain, and point MetaMask to `localhost:8545`, or replace the port with what you have set in your workspace.

### Level One: The `AssociateProfitSplitter` Contract

At the top of your contract, you will need to define the following `public` variables:

* `employee_one` -- The `address` of the first employee. Make sure to set this to `payable`.

* `employee_two` -- Another `address payable` that represents the second employee.

* `employee_three` -- The third `address payable` that represents the third employee.

Create a constructor function that accepts:

* `address payable _one`

* `address payable _two`

* `address payable _three`

Within the constructor, set the employee addresses to equal the parameter values. This will allow you to avoid hardcoding the employee addresses.

Next, create the following functions:

* `balance` -- This function should be set to `public view returns(uint)`, and must return the contract's current balance. Since we should always be sending Ether to the beneficiaries, this function should always return `0`. If it does not, the `deposit` function is not handling the remainders properly and should be fixed. This will serve as a test function of sorts.

* `deposit` -- This function should set to `public payable` check, ensuring that only the owner can call the function.

  * In this function, perform the following steps:

    * Set a `uint amount` to equal `msg.value / 3;` in order to calculate the split value of the Ether.

    * Transfer the `amount` to `employee_one`.

    * Repeat the steps for `employee_two` and `employee_three`.

    * Since `uint` only contains positive whole numbers, and Solidity does not fully support float/decimals, we must deal with a potential remainder at the end of this function since `amount` will discard the remainder during division.

    * We may either have `1` or `2` wei leftover, so transfer the `msg.value - amount * 3` back to `msg.sender`. This will re-multiply the `amount` by 3, then subtract it from the `msg.value` to account for any leftover wei, and send it back to Human Resources.

* Create a fallback function using `function() external payable`, and call the `deposit` function from within it. This will ensure that the logic in `deposit` executes if Ether is sent directly to the contract. This is important to prevent Ether from being locked in the contract since we don't have a `withdraw` function in this use-case.

#### Test the contract

In the `Deploy` tab in Remix, deploy the contract to your local Ganache chain by connecting to `Injected Web3` and ensuring MetaMask is pointed to `localhost:8545`.

You will need to fill in the constructor parameters with your designated `employee` addresses.

Test the `deposit` function by sending various values. Keep an eye on the `employee` balances as you send different amounts of Ether to the contract and ensure the logic is executing properly.



### Level Two: The `TieredProfitSplitter` Contract

In this contract, rather than splitting the profits between Associate-level employees, it will calculate rudimentary percentages for different tiers of employees (CEO, CTO, and Bob).

Using the starter code, within the `deposit` function, perform the following:

* Calculate the number of points/units by dividing `msg.value` by `100`.

  * This will allow us to multiply the points with a number representing a percentage. For example, `points * 60` will output a number that is ~60% of the `msg.value`.

* The `uint amount` variable will be used to store the amount to send each employee temporarily. For each employee, set the `amount` to equal the number of `points` multiplied by the percentage (say, 60 for 60%).

* After calculating the `amount` for the first employee, add the `amount` to the `total` to keep a running total of how much of the `msg.value` we are distributing so far.

* Then, transfer the `amount` to `employee_one`. Repeat the steps for each employee, setting the `amount` to equal the `points` multiplied by their given percentage.

* For example, each transfer should look something like the following for each employee, until after transferring to the third employee:

  * Step 1: `amount = points * 60;`

    * For `employee_one`, distribute `points * 60`.

    * For `employee_two`, distribute `points * 25`.

    * For `employee_three`, distribute `points * 15`.

  * Step 2: `total += amount;`

  * Step 3: `employee_one.transfer(amount);`

* Send the remainder to the employee with the highest percentage by subtracting `total` from `msg.value`, and sending that to an employee.

* Deploy and test the contract functionality by depositing various Ether values (greater than 100 wei).

  * The provided `balance` function can be used as a test to see if the logic you have in the `deposit` function is valid. Since all of the Ether should be transferred to employees, this function should always return `0`, since the contract should never store Ether itself.

  * Note: The 100 wei threshold is due to the way we calculate the points. If we send less than 100 wei, for example, 80 wei, `points` would equal `0` because `80 / 100` equals `0` because the remainder is discarded. We will learn more advanced arbitrary precision division later in the course. In this case, we can disregard the threshold as 100 wei is a significantly smaller value than the Ether or Gwei units that are far more commonly used in the real world (most people aren't sending less than a penny's worth of Ether).



### Deploy the contracts to a live Testnet

Once you feel comfortable with your contracts, point MetaMask to the Kovan or Ropsten network. Ensure you have test Ether on this network!

After switching MetaMask to Kovan, deploy the contracts as before and copy/keep a note of their deployed addresses. The transactions will also be in your MetaMask history, and on the blockchain permanently to explore later.
